# Forecasting_Project
This is an Excel Forecasting Project where where Youtube views are forecasted.

Project Overview:

This project focuses on forecasting time series data, specifically predicting future view counts based on historical data. The project includes a detailed comparison between actual and forecasted values to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting model.


Files and Structure:

Forecasting_Project.xlsx: The main file containing the data and results of the forecasting analysis.
Data Validation: This sheet contains the actual views, forecasted values, and the corresponding dates. It is used to validate the forecasting model's accuracy.
RM- YT Data: This sheet holds the raw historical data, including dates and view counts, which serve as the input for the forecasting model.

How to Use:

Data Preparation: The "RM- YT Data" sheet provides the historical data necessary for training and testing the forecasting model.
Forecasting: The model uses this historical data to generate forecasts, which are then stored in the "Data Validation" sheet alongside actual values for comparison.
Validation: The "Data Validation" sheet is used to assess the performance of the forecasting model by comparing the forecasted values with the actual views.

Tools and Libraries:
Microsoft Excel for data storage and initial analysis.

Results:

The results of the forecasting model can be seen in the "Data Validation" sheet, where the forecasted values are listed alongside the actual views. The accuracy of the model can be evaluated by comparing these columns.

Conclusion:

This project provides a practical example of time series forecasting using historical data. The model's performance is validated by comparing its predictions with actual outcomes, making it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting trends in viewership.
